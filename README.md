# [Rolling Realms](https://olgam4.github.io/rolling-realms/)

> In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, a time of self-isolation for many people, Jamey decided to create an infinitely scaling roll-and-write game to teach and play with people around the world via Facebook Live.
>
> In Rolling Realms, players compete to earn the most stars in a series of minigames over 3 rounds. This is a roll-and-write game, meaning that players will write on the game components using dry-erase markers.
>
> Each turn, one player rolls 2 dice, and all players use the dice results on their realm cards to generate resources and earn stars. After 3 rounds, the player with the most stars wins!

This project aims to let people play the Rolling Realms PnP game remotely. There are other digital versions, but I was looking for a project to try and tackle myself. Also, I love the community around this game, having played lots of variants found on the [BGG Forums](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/305682/rolling-realms/forums/69).

To give back to the community, I built this app and plan to keep updating it with new Realms, features and UI enhancements.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn deploy`

Will first run `predeploy`, which itself runs `yarn build`.

Afterwards, it will use gh-pages to deploy the `build` folder resulting from `predeploy`.
